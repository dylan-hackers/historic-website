<h1>13.4.3   <a name="marker-9-644"></a>The imple<a name="marker-2-645"></a>mentation module</h1>
<p>Our <code>time</code> interface module specifies the names that are visible to clients of our library. It also serves to specify the names that must be defined in our implementation. To prepare to define those names, we create a separate implementation module:</p>
<pre>
define module time-implementation
<em>  // Interface module
</em>  use time;
<em>  // Substrate modules
</em>  use format-out;
  use dylan;
end module time-implementation;
</pre>
<p>In the preceding definition, the implementation module uses the <code>time</code> interface module so that it can give definitions to the names that the interface created. The implementation module is also a client module: It is a client of the <code>dylan</code> module, because its definitions use definitions such as <code>define class</code>, <code>&lt;integer&gt;</code>, and <code>*</code> (which are defined by the <code>dylan</code> module of the <code>dylan</code> library); it is also a client of the <code>format-out</code> module, because the <code>say</code> methods are implemented using the <code>format-out</code> function (which is defined in the <code>format-out</code> module of the <code>format-out</code> library).</p>
<p>We can start to envision the <code>time</code> library as shown in <a href="#marker-9-591">Figure 13.3</a>. In a library more complicated than the time library, we might decompose the construction of the library into several implementation modules. For example, we might want to assign the implementation of the <code>&lt;sixty-unit&gt;</code> substrate to another programmer, and to create an interface between that substrate and the rest of the implementation so that work on either side of the interface can proceed in parallel. In that case, we might use the following module definitions:</p>
<pre>
define module sixty-unit
<em>  // External interface
</em>  use time;
<em>  // Internal interface
</em>  export &lt;sixty-unit&gt;, total-seconds, decode-total-seconds;
<em>  // Substrate module
</em>  use dylan;
end module sixty-unit;
</pre>
<p></p>
<table border="1"><caption>Figure 13.3   <a name="marker-9-591"></a>Initial <code>time</code> library.</caption><tr valign="top"><td><p><a name="marker-10-592"></a><img alt="db20im23" src="db20im23.gif" /></p>
</td></tr></table><pre>
define module time-implementation
<em>  // External interface
</em>  use time;
<em>  // Substrate modules
</em>  use sixty-unit;
  use format-out;
  use dylan;
end module time-implementation;
</pre>
<p>Here, because the <code>sixty-unit</code> module is an internal interface, we forgo the formality of creating a separate implementation module; we simply <code>export</code> the definitions that we expect to be used by other modules within the library. This approach is perhaps a short-sighted one. If later we want the <code>sixty-unit</code> functionality to be available to another library, we will be faced with reorganizing its module definitions (as we shall see in <a href="db_212.html#marker-9-653">Section 13.8, page 209</a>). Even within a library, it is good practice to organize modules as interface and implementation.</p>
<p>Notice the distinction between the way that we handled the external <code>time</code> interface, and the shortcut we took with <code>sixty-unit</code>. Although the <code>sixty-unit</code> module will <em>define</em> <code>encode-total-seconds</code>, which is part of the <code>time</code> interface, it does not <em>export</em> <code>encode-total-seconds</code>; rather, it <em>uses</em> the <code>time</code> interface module, which <em>created</em> <code>encode-total-seconds</code> (without defining that function). Because <code>sixty-unit</code> uses <code>time</code>, the name <code>encode-total-seconds</code> is the same object in both modules. Effectively, <code>encode-total-seconds</code> is owned by the <code>time</code> module, although it is defined by the <code>sixty-unit</code> module.</p>
<p>This organization of the external interface may appear odd at first, but it reduces duplication that would otherwise have to occur: If <code>sixty-unit</code> exported <code>encode-total-seconds</code>, then, for it to be visible at the interface of the library, either the <code>sixty-unit</code> module would have to be exported from the library as an interface (which export is undesirable, because the <code>sixty-unit</code> module has other exports that are not intended to be visible outside the library), or the <code>time</code> interface module would have to use <code>sixty-unit</code> and to re-export <code>encode-total-seconds</code>. The <a name="marker-2-646"></a><code>create</code> clause provides the cleaner solution of allowing a name to be exported from only the one interface module, defined in a separate implementation module (without exposing the implementation module), and used by many client modules.</p>
<p>Dylan requires that all the variables exported via the <code>create</code> clause be defined by some module in the same library; however, they can be defined in any module, and the interface definitions can be spread over several implementation modules. The compiler will verify that the interface is implemented completely, even if its implementation is spread over several modules, by checking when the library is compiled that each created name has a definition.</p>
<p>The <code>sixty-unit</code> module exports the class <code>&lt;sixty-unit&gt;</code>, because <code>time-implementation</code> will subclass that class. The <code>sixty-unit</code> module also exports the generic functions <code>total-seconds</code>, and <code>decode-total-seconds</code>. The export of <code>total-seconds</code> might seem surprising at first, because, in many object-oriented languages, access to a class includes access to all the slots of a class. In Dylan, slots are simply methods on generic functions and names in the module namespace; hence, the functions must be exported if slot access from outside the module is to be allowed. Note that exporting <code>total-seconds</code> allows other modules only to get the current value of the <code>total-seconds</code> slot. To allow other modules also to set the slot value, we would have to export <code>total-seconds-setter</code>. It is not necessary to export the init keyword <code>total-seconds:</code>, which allows the initial value of the slot to be set when objects are created. <a name="marker-2-647"></a>Keywords, or symbols, all exist in a single global namespace that is separate from module variables.</p>
<p></p>
<table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td><p><strong>Comparison with <a name="marker-2-585"></a>C++:</strong> Dylan modules provide access control similar to that provided by the <code>private:</code> and <code>public:</code> keywords in C++ classes, but Dylan access control is done at the module, rather than at the class, level. Dylan has no equivalent to <code>protected:</code> access control, in that a class that subclasses a class from another module does <em>not</em> have access to slots or other generic functions on its superclass from the other module, unless they are explicitly exported from that <br />module.</p>
<p>Dylan does support multiple interfaces, however; different levels of access can be provided by having more than one interface module, each supplying the access needed for the particular interface.</p>
<p>One way to think of Dylan access control in C++ terms is that all definitions in a module are <code>friend</code>s of all classes in the module, and the exported definitions of the module are <code>public</code>.</p>
</td></tr></table><p></p>
<p>Breaking out the <code>sixty-unit</code> substrate to a separate module creates a slightly more complicated structure to our diagram, as shown in <a href="#marker-9-596">Figure 13.4</a>.</p>

</td></tr></table><p>In <a href="#marker-9-596">Figure 13.4</a>, we show the definitions of <code>sixty-unit</code> in a separate module. The <code>sixty-unit</code> module is a client of <code>dylan</code>, an interface and implementation of definitions used by <code>time-implementation</code> (that is, <code>time-implementation</code> is a client of <code>sixty-unit</code>), and an implementation of part of the interface created by <code>time</code>. </p>
