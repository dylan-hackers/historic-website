<h1>18.5   Use of <a name="marker-2-742"></a>multiple inheritance</h1>
<p>Multiple inheritance is likely to be most useful when you can separate the characteristics of objects into <strong>orthogonal</strong> sets, in which the characteristics of one set do not depend on the characteristics of other sets. If you can define a class to represent each set of characteristics, you can use multiple inheritance to build complex classes with different combinations of characteristics. We gave a glimpse of how to create such a design by starting to segregate characteristics of flying and ground vehicles, and then noting that certain vehicles, like such as aircraft, can combine both sets of characteristics.</p>
<p>Another approach that can be useful for various applications is to create one or more <a name="marker-2-743"></a><strong>base</strong> superclasses, which define common characteristics of subclasses, and a number of <a name="marker-2-744"></a><strong>mix-in</strong> classes, each of which adds a set of orthogonal characteristics. A mix-in class is like an addition, such as chocolate chips or nuts, that might be mixed into an ice-cream base. Another way to think about this approach is to imagine the base class as a noun and the mix-in classes as adjectives that modify or specialize the noun. You can then construct concrete subclasses by using multiple inheritance. For each concrete subclass, one or more mix-in classes typically precede a single base class in the list of superclasses.</p>
