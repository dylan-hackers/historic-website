<h1>Program examples</h1>
<p>This book includes many program examples. Our approach is to show how evolutionary programming might work by presenting an example simply at first, and then expanding it gradually. </p>
<p>In Part I,  <em>Basic Concepts</em>, we develop an example of a simple library that represents time and position. That library is needed for the sample airport application that we develop in Part III,  <em>Sample Application</em>. The airport application simulates airplanes, runways, gates, flights, and airports. Its goal is to schedule gates for arriving and departing aircraft. To do scheduling, we need the library that represents and manipulates time and position. </p>
<p>You can download the source code of the program examples. See <a href="db_338.html#marker-9-881"><em>Source Code of Program Examples</em></a>.</p>
<p>Dylan's core language is lean. It does not include input-output facilities, support for a user interface, or interfaces for communicating with programs written in other languages. These features are available in libraries supplied by vendors or in the public domain. We want this book to be applicable to the widest possible range of Dylan implementations, so we focus on the core Dylan language, and use only those library interfaces that are widely available.</p>
