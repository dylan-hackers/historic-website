<h1>4.1   Requirements of the time and position classes and methods</h1>
<p>Our eventual goal in this book is to develop a sample application based on an airport theme. The sample application handles the scheduling of aircraft that are arriving into and departing from an airport. For more information, see <a href="db_243.html#marker-9-678">Chapter 15,  <em>Design of the Airport Application</em></a>. </p>
<p>We know that, for our airport application, we need to represent time. There are several ways to represent time. We could say that an event happened 2 hours ago (a time offset). We could say that an event happened at 21:30 (a time of day). We must represent both kinds of time in our time library, and we must provide a way to print representations of both. In this chapter, we define a class named <code>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</code>, and we define a method that prints a representation of <code>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</code>. In <a href="db_63.html#marker-9-201">Chapter 5,  <em>Class Inheritance</em></a>, we define the <code>&lt;time-offset&gt;</code> class, and a method that prints a representation of <code>&lt;time-offset&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The airport application also requires us to represent physical objects (such as aircraft), and the positions (locations) of physical objects. In <a href="db_92.html#marker-9-264">Chapter 7</a>,<br /><a href="db_92.html#marker-9-264"><em>Modularity</em></a>, we define classes that represent physical objects and positions. </p>
<p>Eventually, we need to be able to add times, to compare times for similarity, and to determine which of two times is greater than the other. We implement those operations in <a href="db_84.html#marker-9-241">Chapter 6,  <em>Multimethods</em></a>.</p>
<p>We package the result of all our work into a complete and working library, in <a href="db_103.html#marker-9-278">Chapter 8,  <em>A Simple Library</em></a>. Later, we refine this library to achieve greater modularity and extensibility. The final result is given in <a href="db_223.html#marker-9-666">Chapter 14,  <em>Four Complete Libraries</em></a>.</p>
