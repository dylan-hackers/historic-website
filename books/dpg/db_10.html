<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>We are fortunate to have at Harlequin a great pool of Dylan talent and expertise, including original inventors of the language, compiler gurus, and environment designers. A core group of Dylan experts and two expert C programmers gave us valuable technical advice and encouragement from the first to the final days of our project: Freeland Abbott, Jonathan Bachrach, Kim Barrett, Paul Butcher, Paul Haahr, Tony Mann, and Keith Playford. Other people reviewed our drafts along the way: Roman Budzianowski, Bob Cassels, Edward Cessna, Bill Chiles, Christopher Fry, David Gray, Eliot Miranda, Scott McKay, Nosa Omorogbe, Mike Plusch, and Andy Sizer. We are grateful to Harlequin people whose expertise lies in programming languages other than Dylan, for giving us their perspectives on our book: Judy Anderson, Wesley Dunnington, David Jones, Andy Latto, Peter Norvig, Kent Pitman, Steve Rowley, Craig Swanson, Jason Trenouth, Helen Vickers, and Evan Williams. </p>
<p>Andrew Shires carefully tested all our program examples. Brent Tennefoss gave us a great deal of help with graphics. Gary Palter shared his Macintosh expertise, and Leah Bateman shared her Windows expertise. Richard Brooksby let us steal time from other projects to write this book. Anne Altherr, Sharon Van Gundy, Clive Harris, and Sang Lee helped us to navigate the legal and business issues. Ken Jackson helped us to get the ball rolling, and gave it an extra push when needed. Jo Marks is one of Dylan's biggest fans -- he urged us to write this book as a way to explain the power of Dylan to a wider audience.</p>
<p>We are grateful to Dylan experts outside of Harlequin who gave us thoughtful and thorough reviews of the book: Scott Fahlman, Robert Futrelle, David Moon, and Andrew Shalit.</p>
<p>Our editors at Addison-Wesley cheerfully and capably steered us through the process and helped to shape our book. We are grateful to Sarah Hallet Corey, Lyn Dupr&eacute;, Nancy Fenton, and Helen Goldstein. Eileen Hoff designed the cover using Bachrach's image. It was, once again, a great pleasure to work with Peter Gordon.</p>
<p>We thank the people at Apple Computer who combined their vision of the future with hard work to make Dylan a reality. We thank the people at Carnegie Mellon University and Harlequin who continue to move Dylan forward with insight and creativity. </p>
