<h1>4.2.1   The <em>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</em> class</h1>
<p>We start by defining a class to represent the concept of a time of day, such as 21:30. The definition of the <code>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</code> class is as follows:</p>
<pre>
<em>// A specific time of day from 00:00 (midnight) to below 24:00 (tomorrow)
</em>define class &lt;time-of-day&gt; (&lt;object&gt;)	<em>// 1
</em>  slot total-seconds :: &lt;integer&gt;;	<em>// 2
</em>end class &lt;time-of-day&gt;;	<em>// 3 </em>
</pre>
<p>The top line is a <strong><a name="marker-2-160"></a>comment</strong>. The <em>//</em> characters begin a comment, which continues to the end of the line. We also provide comments that number the lines of code after the first comment. The line numbers are useful only for discussing the code examples in the book, and would not be used in source files. You can also have multiline comments that start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>.</p>
<p>On line 1, the words <a name="marker-2-161"></a><code>define class</code> start the class definition. The name of the class is <code>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</code>. The list following the name of the class is a list of the direct superclasses of this class. The <code>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</code> class has one direct superclass, which is the class <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>. Each user-defined class must have at least one direct superclass. If no other class is appropriate, the class must have <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> as its superclass. </p>
<p>Line 2 contains the only slot definition of this class. This class has one slot, named <code>total-seconds</code>. The slot's type constraint is <code>&lt;integer&gt;</code>. The double colon, <code>::</code>, specifies the type constraint of a slot, just as it specifies the type constraint of a module variable or of a method's parameter. </p>
<p>Line 3 is the end of the class definition. The text after the word <code>end</code> and before the semicolon is an optional part of the definition; it documents which definition is ending. Any text appearing after the <code>end</code> must match the definition ending, such as <code>end class &lt;time-of-day&gt;</code>, or <code>end class</code>. You do not need to put any text after the <code>end</code> &mdash; however, such text is useful for long or complex definitions, where it can be difficult to see which language construct is ending. </p>
