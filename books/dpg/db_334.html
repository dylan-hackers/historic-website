<h1>21.5   <a name="marker-9-876"></a>More complex rules</h1>
<p>The macros shown so far have all been simple: a single pattern transformed into a single template. To get a flavor of the full power of the Dylan macro system, consider this <a name="marker-2-877"></a><strong>defining macro</strong>:</p>
<pre>
define macro aircraft-definer
  { define aircraft ?identifier:name (?type:name) ?flights end }
   =&gt; { register-aircraft(make(&quot;&lt;&quot; ## ?type ## &quot;&gt;&quot;, id: ?#&quot;identifier&quot;));
        register-flights(?#&quot;identifier&quot;, ?flights) }
flights:
  { }
   =&gt; { }
  { ?flight; ... }
   =&gt; { ?flight, ... }
flight:
  { flight ?id:name, #rest ?options:expression }
   =&gt; { make(&lt;flight&gt;, id: ?#&quot;id&quot;, ?options) }
end macro aircraft-definer;
</pre>
<p>We might use the macro <code>define aircraft</code> as follows:</p>
<pre>
define aircraft UA4906H (DC10)
  flight UA11, from: #&quot;BOS&quot;, to: #&quot;SFO&quot;;
  flight UA12, from: #&quot;SFO&quot;, to: #&quot;BOS&quot;;
end aircraft UA4906H;
</pre>
<p>This macro shows a number of the more esoteric features of Dylan macros. First, notice the pattern variable <code>?flights</code>, which has no constraint, but rather is called out as an <strong><a name="marker-2-878"></a>auxiliary rule</strong>. When the compiler matches this macro, it will try each of the auxiliary rule's patterns listed under <code>flights:</code> for a match. When it finds a match, it will assign the pattern variable <code>?flights</code> to the fragment resulting from the matching pattern's template substitution. In effect, auxiliary rules give a way of writing new constraints, combined with the effect of a subroutine for matching and substitution.</p>
<p>In this particular case, we use the auxiliary rule to map yet another auxiliary rule, <code>flight</code>, over a sequence of flight descriptions that look similar to the slot descriptions in a class. The mapping is signaled by the points of ellipsis (<code>...</code>) which means that the rule should be applied recursively (that is, the current rule is matched again to the fragment that matches <code>...</code>). Note that <code>flights</code> must have a rule to cover the case of there being no flight; that rule also handles the end of the recursion when the final flight has been matched.</p>
<p>The <code>flight</code> rule simply converts each flight name and its options into the appropriate call to <code>make</code>, to create the flight. We could extend this rule to allow a more natural specification for flight origin, destination, and time.</p>
<p>We do the work of defining an aircraft by calling the helper functions <br /><code>register-aircraft</code> and <code>register-flights</code> (which are not given here), but the macro takes care of getting the arguments in order. The substitution &quot;&lt;&quot; <code>## ?type ## &quot;&gt;&quot;</code> turns the name <code>DC10</code> into the name <code>&lt;DC10&gt;</code> by using <br /><strong>concatenation</strong>, allowing a more concise format for our definer while maintaining our convention for naming types. The substitution <code>?#&quot;identifier&quot;</code> turns the name <code>UA1306</code> into the symbol <code>#&quot;UA1306&quot;</code> by using <strong>coercion</strong>; the program can use the symbol <code>#&quot;UA1306&quot;</code> to look up an aircraft in the registry by name. The template for <code>flights</code> collects all the individual flights into a comma-separated list that is passed to <code>register-flights</code> as a <code>#rest</code> argument.</p>
