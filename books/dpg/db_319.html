<h1>20.1.2   Problems with the informal exception protocol</h1>
<p>There are several significant problems with the approach used in <a href="db_318.html#marker-9-822">Section 20.1.1</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As we saw in the <code>correct-arrival-time</code> method, most callers of the <code>+</code> function must check the type of the value returned. This type checking breaks up the normal flow of control, and gives as much weight to the unusual case (the exception) as it does to the usual case. If a caller fails to check the return value to see whether that value is a string, then a different error will occur later in the program (such as adding a string and time together), when it might be hard to trace back the problem to the original point of failure. Note that both direct callers of <code>+</code> (<code>correct-arrival-time</code>) and indirect callers of <code>+</code> (<code>say-corrected-time</code>) must understand and use this error protocol correctly. </p></li>
<li><p>For other methods that might return any object (including strings, for example), an additional return value would have to be used to indicate that an exception occurred. It would be easy to forget to check the extra return value and such failure could easily go undetected, causing unpredictable program behavior. If the method is being added to a generic function in another library, it might be impossible to add a second return value indicating failure, because the generic function might limit the number of return values.</p></li>
<li><p>A casual reader of the code could become easily confused about this ad hoc error protocol. Someone might inadvertently write code that did not obey this ad hoc protocol. Also, if all programmers use their own error protocols, it will be hard to remember which convention to obey at the call site; programmers will have to check the convention in the source code or programmer documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>In this example, the ability to restrict the return value to only <code>&lt;time-of-day&gt;</code> is lost. This loss might prevent compile-time error checking that could catch errors that would be difficult or inconvenient to catch at run time. It might also prevent the compiler from optimizing code that uses the results of this function, thus decreasing performance of the application.</p></li>
<li><p>We are limited in how we can respond to the error. The context in which the error was detected has been lost. There is no state we can examine to gather more details about the error, and to determine why the error occurred. We also cannot correct whatever caused the problem, then continue from the point where the error occurred.</p></li>
</ul>
