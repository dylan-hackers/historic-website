<h1>7.7.1   Instantiable classes</h1>
<p>A class that can be used as the first argument to <code>make</code> is an <strong>instantiable</strong> class. All concrete classes are instantiable. When you define an abstract class, Dylan does not provide a method for <code>make</code> that enables you to create direct instances of that class. Thus, if you call <code>make</code> on an abstract class, you get an error.</p>
<p>Even though an abstract class does not have direct instances, it is sometimes possible to use an abstract class as the first argument to <code>make</code>. In this case, the <code>make</code> function creates and returns a direct instance of a concrete subclass of the abstract class. In other words, <code>make</code> can return either a direct or an indirect instance of its first argument. </p>
<p>To make it possible for an abstract class to be provided as the first argument to <code>make</code>, you define the abstract class, and define one or more concrete subclasses of it. You then define a method for <code>make</code> that specializes its first parameter on the abstract class, and that returns an instance of one of its concrete subclasses. To define <code>make</code> methods, you need to use the <code>singleton</code> function to create a type whose only instance is the class itself; see <a href="db_110.html#marker-9-288">Chapter 9,  <em>Nonclass Types</em></a>. Definition of <code>make</code> methods is an advanced topic that we do not cover in this book. </p>
<p>What is the reason for enabling users to call <code>make</code> on an abstract class? This flexibility allows a program that needs a general kind of object, represented by a superclass, to ask for an instance of the superclass without specifying the direct class of the instance. For example, a program might need to store data in a vector, but might not be concerned about the specific implementation of the vector that it uses. Such a program can create a vector by calling <code>make</code> with the argument <br /><code>&lt;vector&gt;</code>, and <code>make</code> will create an instance of a concrete subclass. The built-in <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code> class is abstract, but is instantiable. </p>
