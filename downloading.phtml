<P><EM>Gwydion Dylan 2.2 is a technology preview, not finished software. Be
sure the review the <A HREF="limitations.phtml">limitations</A>.</EM></P>

<P>To use the d2c compiler, you'll normally want to download precompiled
binaries for your platform. (d2c is written in Dylan). Binary tarballs are
available for several different platforms, and the following RPMs are
available:</P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>gwydion-dylan:</STRONG> Binaries for the d2c compiler and the
Melange interface generator. Most of the documentation is in this package.
<LI><STRONG>gwydion-dylan-extras:</STRONG> Various utilities which
generally aren't required to use Gwydion Dylan. Skip these unless you need
something specific.
<LI><STRONG>mindy:</STRONG> The Mindy Dylan interpreter. A very small
download, but it doesn't contain much documentation. You can find
everything that's missing on this web site.
</UL>

<P>Debian packages (or native packages for proprietary Unices) will be
provided if somebody offers to build them for us.</P>
