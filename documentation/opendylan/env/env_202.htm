<H1>C.3.2   Editing page</H1>
<P>The Editor Options dialog's Editing page contains options related to manipulating files and their contents in the editor. </P>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME=MARKER-10-782></A>Use the clipboard as well as the "kill ring" for "Cut" and "Copy"<DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>If this box is checked, cut and copy operations put the selection onto the Windows clipboard, so that it can be pasted into other applications.
<DT><DD>In both modes the selection is also added to an internal "kill ring", like in GNU Emacs. This feature allows you to paste an item that you cut or copied. In Emacs mode, use Ctrl+Y to paste the most recent item added to the kill ring and then you can use Alt+Y to cycle back through items previously saved to the kill ring.
<DT><DD>This box is checked in both Windows mode and Emacs mode.
<DT>Replace the selection when a character is typed<DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>If this box is checked, then typing a character when there is a selection deletes that selection and inserts the character you typed in its place. If this box is not checked, typing a character cancels the selection and then inserts the character as normal.
<DT><DD>In Windows mode, this box is checked. In Emacs mode, it is not checked.
<DT>Copy the current line with "Copy" if there is no selection <DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>If this box is checked, and you perform a copy operation when there is no selection, the editor copies the current line.
<DT><DD>This box is checked in both Windows mode and Emacs mode.
<DT>Add a blank line when the cursor moves down at the end of a file<DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>If this box is checked, moving the cursor down at the end of a file inserts a new line. If it is not checked, the editor does not insert a new line and the cursor does not move. 
<DT><DD>In Windows mode, this box is not checked. In Emacs mode, it is checked. 
<DT>Maintain files' undo/redo history after saving them<DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>The editor maintains a separate undo history for each file. If this box is checked, the undo history is retained after you save a file. If it is not checked, the undo history is emptied upon saving. 
<DT><DD>This box is not checked in Windows mode or Emacs mode.
<DT>Offer a choice of file when closing a file from the keyboard<DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>If this box is checked, when you close a file by using keyboard commands a dialog asks you which file to close if more than one file is open.
<DT><DD>In Windows mode, this box is not checked. In Emacs mode, it is checked. 
<DT>Ask for a file name when creating a new file<DD><P></P>
<DT><DD>If this box is checked, the editor prompts you for a file name when you create a new file. If it is not checked, the editor assigns names to new files automatically.
<DT><DD>In Windows mode, this box is not checked. In Emacs mode, it is checked.
