<H1>6.16   <A NAME=MARKER-10-568></A>Just-in-time debugging</H1>
<P><B>Note:</B> <A NAME=MARKER-2-569></A>This section does not <A NAME=MARKER-2-570></A>apply to the Functional Developer Personal Edition.</P>
<P>The Windows operating system has the built-in capability to perform "just-in-time" debugging. Just-in-time, or JIT, debugging is where an application crashes while not running under a debugger, and the operating system arranges to start up an available debugger and attach it to the crashed process in order to obtain a backtrace. The system registry contains an entry for the debugger that should be invoked when this happens. The Functional Developer Professional and Enterprise Editions are capable of acting as a JIT debugger; during the installation process you have the opportunity to install Functional Developer as your machine's default debugger.</P>
<P>If you set Functional Developer up as your JIT debugger, it is simple to make a connection to the Functional Developer debugger "just in time". When the application signals an error, and that error is unhandled, the operating system displays a dialog giving you a chance to attach to a debugger. If you then click <B>Debug</B> in the dialog, the Functional Developer debugger can attach to the application.</P>
<P>That is the procedure for console applications. Attaching the debugger to a DUIM application takes slightly longer. DUIM applications have a <CODE>default-handler</CODE> method that displays a standard dialog describing the unhandled Dylan error, and offering the chance to terminate the application (<B>Yes</B> button), ignore the error (<B>No</B> button), or debug the application (<B>Cancel</B> button). This is the dialog that we saw in <A HREF="env_25.htm#MARKER-9-228">"Problems at run time" on page 24</A>. </P>
<P>To attach the debugger in this situation, click <B>Cancel</B>. Because the application is not running under a debugger already, the error falls through to be caught by the operating system. At this point, the operating system displays its dialog and you can click <B>Debug</B> to make the Functional Developer debugger attach.</P>
<P>Once the debugger attaches successfully, another dialog appears, asking whether you would like to open a project. If the crashed process is a Dylan application for which you have a project, you should take this opportunity to open the related project before you start your debugging.</P>
<P><A NAME=MARKER-10-571></A>It is not strictly necessary to open a project, since the debugger will still be able to use whatever debugging information is available in the executable file itself in order to provide a backtrace. But it is worth opening a project because you can then browse the source code or the definitions in the project, and use the interactor<A NAME=MARKER-2-572></A> to evaluate Dylan expressions. </P>
<P>(Of course, if the crashed application is not a Dylan application at all, and also does not contain any embedded Dylan components, then you will not be able to open a project.)</P>
<P>Once you have made your selection and have clicked <B>OK</B>, the Functional Developer debugger window appears. The debugger provides a full description of the state of the program at the point of the crash. You can then start to debug the application in the normal <A NAME=MARKER-2-573></A>way.</P>
