Instructions on building d2c:

	- ``cd /afs/cs/poject/gwydion/compiler/src'' and then run rcsupdate
	- cd /afs/cs/project/gwydion/compiler/build/@sys
          where @sys is the name of the architecture you intend to build for 
	- run mk-build-tree
	- gmake
	- make sure everything worked correctly
	- save a copy of the old compiler
	    copy gwydion/compiler/bin/d2c to d2c-date where date is
            the date the old version was compiled.
	- gmake install
