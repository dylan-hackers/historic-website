<H1><IMG SRC="small-dylan-logo.gif" height=28 width=28> The Dylan Language Standard </H1>

From 1992 to 1995, the Dylan Language was defined and refined by Apple
Computer, in cooperation with other members of the Dylan community.  The
culmination of this effort was a draft <I>Dylan Reference Manual</I>
(or <I>DRM-TR</I> for short), which was released along with the
"Apple Dylan Technology Release" software, in November 1995.
<A HREF="mailto:alms@folly.org">Andrew Shalit</A>, the principal author
of the <I>DRM-TR</I>, has since written an updated version, incorporating
many corrections and clarifications suggested by the Dylan community.
This updated <I>Dylan Reference Manual</I> (or <I>DRM</I> for short)
was published by
<A HREF="http://www.awl.com/cseng/titles/0-201-44211-6/">Addison-Wesley</A>
in September 1996.  The book is 470 pages, and its ISBN number is
0-201-44211-6.  It is available for purchase at a discount at
<a href="http://www.fun-o.com/products/books.phtml">Functional Objects, inc.</a>


<P>
The <I>DRM-TR</I> has been superceeded by the <I>DRM</I> which is now
available <a href="http://www.gwydiondylan.org/drm/drm_1.htm">here</a>
at the <a href="http://www.gwydiondylan.org">Gwydion Dylan Maintainers</a>
web site.

<P>
You can see a list of <A HREF="whats-new.html"><B>what's new</B></A>
on these pages.

<P>
The <I>Dylan Reference Manual</I> is meant as a reference work for
programmers and language implementors.  For people who want to start
learning and using Dylan, the book
<A HREF="http://www.fun-o.com/products/books.phtml#dp">
Dylan Programming</A> is more appropriate.  The authors are Neal Feinberg,
Sonya E. Keene, Robert O. Mathews, and P. Tucker Withington.

<P>
<I>Dylan Programming</I> is a tutorial on programming in Dylan.  It is full of
examples, hints, and practical advice.  It starts with the most basic
use of Dylan (including an object-oriented tutorial), and proceeds to
more advanced topics such as multiple inheritance, performance,
exceptions, and macros.
The book is 412 pages, and its ISBN number is 0-201-47976-1.

<H2><IMG SRC="small-dylan-logo.gif" height=28 width=28> The Evolution of the Dylan Language Standard</H2>

There will be an inevitable need to update the Dylan language even now, after
the <I>DRM</I> has been published.  There is also a need to define
libraries that are not part of the language but are agreed to be standard.

<P>
The Dylan community, lead by 
Harlequin and <A HREF="http://LEGEND.GWYDION.CS.CMU.EDU/gwydion/">CMU</A>, had
established a procedure whereby change proposals (in a
<A HREF="form.html">standard format</A>) can be sent to the
<!-- mailing list is intentionally not a "mailto" the mailing list -->
<I>dylan-partners@camellia.org</I>
mailing list. 
Proposals were discussed on that list by
interested participants.  A moderator was responsible for setting a
reasonable cut-off date for comments on each proposal, recording the
consensus decision in the evolving language standard documents (here
on these pages), and making decisions when there is a lack of
consensus. Currently, 
<A HREF="mailto:kab@camellia.org">Kim Barrett</A> maintains the Dylan
Language standard.

<P>
In addition, a list of
<A HREF="http://www2.primushost.net/~alms/dylan/drm_errata.html"><I>DRM errata</I></A>
is being maintained by <A HREF="mailto:alms@folly.org">Andrew Shalit</A>.

<H2><IMG SRC="small-dylan-logo.gif" height=28 width=28> List of Standard Libraries</H2>

The Common-Dylan specification, which is not to be found in written form,
but has an implementation and documentation as Functional Developer's
<a href="http://www.fun-o.com/products/doc/core/index.htm">Common Dylan</a>
and <a href="http://www.fun-o.com/products/doc/io/index.htm">System and I/O</a>
libraries is the agreed-on standard.

<p>
The below libraries where the libraries that began discussions on the 
common-dylan specification:

<OL>
<LI> Interface to non-Dylan code (Melange/Collage)
<LI> Graphical User Interface and Event Handling (Silica/DUIM)
<LI> Streams
<LI> Integers (e.g., unlimited precision integers)
<LI> Print (Print and Pretty-print modules) and Format libraries
<LI> Format-out and Standard-io Libraries
<LI> Implementation-interrogation or Platform-query Library
<LI> Language extensions (e.g., one-of, false-or)
</OL>
