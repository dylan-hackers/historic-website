<!-- This file symbolically lives at the root of the Gwydion Dylan tree, though
its actual location is docs/htdocs/dylan-index.html.  The purpose behind this
is to have the root of the Gwydion Dylan tree be the same as the root of the
gwydion Dylan web.  Not only is this possibly more useful to someone browsing
the project area, but also more importantly, this allows the HTML to refer to
any part of the Gwydion Dylan tree using a relative pathname.  

Within the Gwydion Dylan tree, relative pathname are used for all internal
links, allowing the entire tree to be mirrored, web and all.  Links *outside*
of the Gwydion Dylan tree (e.g. to the Gwydion or Dylan homepages) are always
absolute, hosted at http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu/, even though the actual
page does have a well-defined relative location at CMU. -->

Gwydion Dylan is freely available implementation of a dynamic language strongly
resembling
the language defined in the

Dylan Reference Manual</A>.  Gwydion Dylan differs in a number of ways from the
official language definition, see

Gwydion Dylan provides two different execution engines:
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="docs/htdocs/d2c.html">d2c</A>
<DD>An optimizing Dylan to C compiler which offers reasonably good runtime
speed, but compilations are relatively slow and debugging
facilities are less convenient that in Mindy.

<DT><A href="docs/maker-out/mindy.htm">Mindy</A>
<DD>A byte-code compiler which offers extremely fast compilation, reasonably
good debuggability, and slow runtime speed.  Mindy is also somewhat more
portable, and is available on more platforms.  This is an update of our earlier
Mindy releases.

The current Gwydion Dylan is version 2.0.  See the
<A HREF="src/Changes.html">change log</A> for information on differences from
previous releases.
We have binary distributions built on the following platforms:

      software, its performance, or its conformity to any specification.
<P> 
      Gwydion is a small research project, and most of our effort in the
      near future will be devoted to developing a "hypercode" programming
      environment.  The amount of time and effort we can put into supporting
      this release is extremely limited.  We will try to answer mail to
<A href="mailto:gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu">gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu</A> 
      , but we can't guarantee that our replies
      will be timely or that we will fix every bug reported.  We are
      releasing the Gwydion Dylan source so that users can fix things for
      themselves if they choose to do so.  We encourage users to send
      improvements and bug-fixes to us so that we can add them to future
      releases.

<P>
<DT><H2>Documentation</H2>
<DD>Documentation for Gwydion Dylan is available
<A HREF="docs/htdocs/">on the web</A>.
A <A HREF="release/gd20-html.tar.gz">html distribution</A> is also available if
you want a local mirror.  See also the

<P>
<DT><H2>Source availability</H2>

<DD>The sources to Gwydion Dylan are available in 
<A HREF="release/gd20-source.tar.gz">gd20-source.tar.gz</A>.  You can also 
<A HREF="src/">browse the sources</A>.  See
<A HREF="docs/htdocs/copyright.html">the copyright notice</A> on Gwydion
Dylan for the terms under which the sources are made available.  See
<A HREF="#BUILD">build instructions</A> for information on how to rebuild
from the sources.

<P>
<DT><H2>Requirements</H2>
<DD>

The Mindy byte-interpreter is significantly more portable than the d2c
compiler.  Since <SAMP>mindycomp</SAMP> is written in C, and Mindy makes
thorough use of autoconf to conditionalize itself, it can be easily compiled
from sources on a wide range of Unixes.  To compile Mindy from sources, see the
<A HREF="#BUILD">build instructions</A>.

<P>
In contrast, d2c is a bootstrapped system, written almost entirely in Dylan,
and has been explicitly configured to run on a set of known platforms.
Though it is possible to rebootstrap via Mindy, and the configure script will
attempt to do so if a d2c binary is not found, in practice you don't want to do
this, as it takes nearly forever.  So if you want to run d2c, you need a binary
distribution.  Once you have the binary distribution, you can recompile d2c
from sources if you want.  An additional d2c portability limitation comes from
the use of the Boehm conservative GC; sources are included, but it does have
platform-specific configuration.


<P>
<H3>Unix Requirements</H3>

Compiling Mindy for Unix requires the use of an ANSI C compiler.  We
highly recommend gcc (GNU CC) if it is available.

d2c for Unix requires the gnu tools gmake, gcc, and gas.  gdb is required for
debugging.  The gnu assembler (gas) must be used in conjunction with the
generated code from gcc.  If you somehow end up running the HP/UX "as" with
gcc, it will produce many errors about STAB entries, etc.  We actually have
built d2c using non-Gnu ANSI C compilers and assemblers, as in the
<SAMP>hppa-hpux-shared</SAMP> platform.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="WIN-REQS">Windows Requirements</A></H3>
d2c for NT requires Microsoft Visual C++, the GNU assembler (gas), and
several other Unix-ish utilities like rm, mv, and cmp.  We use the
<A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">
  Cygnus gnu-win32 distribution</A> (this distribution includes the assembler.)
It has an awful lot of problems, but we grudgingly admit that it's
better than nothing.  
d2c is also believed to work with the gnu-win32 gcc, but we haven't built it
that way recently.

<P>
Gwydion Dylan seems to work on Windows '95, but has not been extensively used
on that platform.

<P>
<DT><H2><A NAME=BINARIES>Binary Installation</A></H2>
<DD>
<P>
The binary distributions contain top-level <SAMP>bin</SAMP>, <SAMP>lib</SAMP>,
<SAMP>etc</SAMP> and <SAMP>include</SAMP> directories.  Ideally the
distribution should be unpacked in <SAMP>/usr/local</SAMP> on Unix or
<SAMP>c:\dylan</SAMP> on Windows.  If the binaries are installed somewhere
else, users must set the 
<A HREF="docs/htdocs/d2c.html#ENVIRONMENT">DYLANDIR</A> environment variable
to point to the root directory of the installation before they run d2c or
Mindy.

<P>
You will also want to set your <SAMP>PATH</SAMP> environment variable 
to include the "<SAMP>bin/</SAMP>" directory so that you can actually run the
installed programs.  On Windows you may need to set other 
<A HREF="win32-build.html#ENVIRONMENT">environment variables</A> related to
the C compiler.

<P>
<SAMP>.tar.gz</SAMP> files can be unpackaged by typing:
<PRE>
        gzip -d filename.tar.gz
        tar -xvf filename.tar
</PRE>
<P>

<SAMP>.zip</SAMP> files (Windows only) can be unpackaged with any "unzip"
utility that supports long file names.  PKunzip is not one of these.  A free
unzip utility, the 
<A HREF="http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu/gwydion/dylan/release/unzip.exe">Info-ZIP extractor</A>,
is available in the release area.

<P>
Note about for unpacking the source distribution on Windows: There is a
<SAMP>tar</SAMP> and <SAMP>gzip</SAMP> in the <A
HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">gnu-win32 distribution</A> (<A
HREF="#WIN-REQS">see Windows Requirements</A>), but <SAMP>tar</SAMP> seems
rather flaky.  You might want to try some commercial app such as WinZip.

For help on using Gwydion Dylan, see
<A HREF="docs/htdocs/">the documentation index</A>.

<P>
<DT><H2><A NAME=BUILD>Build Instructions</A></H2>
<DD>

To recompile Gwydion Dylan, you need Perl, which is used by the 
<A HREF="docs/htdocs/tools.html#MAKEGEN">Makegen</a> script.  You will also 
need the
<A HREF="#DISTRIBUTIONS">binary distribution</A>
for your platform in order to get a working d2c.  

<P>Recompiling the entire system takes over an hour on 64meg 200mhz Pentium
Pro running Windows/NT.  This is almost all for the compilation of the d2c
runtime and compiler; compiling just Mindy takes only a few minutes.  d2c also
uses lots of memory, especially when compiling itself: you want at least 48
meg, and more is better.


<P>
Build instructions have been divided into two pages:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="docs/htdocs/unix-build.html">Unix building</A> and some notes on
porting in general.
<LI><A HREF="docs/htdocs/win32-build.html">Windows building</A>
