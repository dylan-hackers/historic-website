<H2>Building Gwydion Dylan on Windows/Win32</H2>
<DL> 
<DT><H2>Install your distributions</H2>

Install <A HREF="http://www.ActiveWare.com">Perl for Win32</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">GnuWin32</A>.
Install the Gwydion Dylan source and binary distributions.  In subsequent
discussion, it is assumed that both the source and binary distributions are
installed at the same root (normally <SAMP>c:\dylan</SAMP>, and this root is
implied when a relative pathname is given.

<DT>
<H2><A NAME=ENVIRONMENT>Set up your environment variables</A></H2>

You will need to set the following variables:
<DL>
<DT>DylanDir<DD> d2c will look for <SAMP>%DylanDir%\etc\platforms.descr</SAMP>.
<DT>Path<DD> Make sure this includes <SAMP>%DylanDir%\bin</SAMP>.  
Put it towards the end.
Also make sure that the Visual C++ <SAMP>cl</SAMP> and <SAMP>nmake</SAMP>
commands are found on Path (e.g. <SAMP>c:\msdev\bin</SAMP>.)  Perl and the Gnu
utilities must also be on Path.
<DT>Include<DD> Add <SAMP>%DylanDir%/include</SAMP> to the include variable.
Make sure that this variable also has the standard VC++ include directories
(e.g. <SAMP>c:\msdev\include</SAMP>.)
<DT>Lib<DD> Add <SAMP>%DylanDir%/lib/dylan</SAMP> to the <SAMP>Lib</SAMP>
environment variable so that the linker can find the objects corresponding to
Dylan libraries.  Make sure that Lib also includes the standard VC++ libraries
(e.g. <SAMP>c:\msdev\lib</SAMP>.)
</DL>

<P>
(Note: The variable names are case insensitive)
<P>
Before going on, make sure you understand how environment variables work in NT.
You set environment variables using the System control in the Control Panel.
NT environment variables don't work quite the way Unix people expect them to.
There are two panels in that window, "System Variables" and "User Variables",
with the former being system wide and the latter being on a per-user basis.
Users can provide their own definitions for system variables, but they don't
override the system definition so much as they append to it.  For instance, if
the system variable PATH was set to "<SAMP>.;c:\winnt35\system32</SAMP>", and
the user variable panel said PATH is "<SAMP>c:\gwydion\bin</SAMP>" , then the
<EM>real</EM> value of PATH is the sum of those,
"<SAMP>.;c:\winnt35\system32;c:\gwydion\bin</SAMP>".

<P>
Finally, make sure you
save your changes: Nothing's really committed until you press the "Ok" button.
Also note that control panel environment variable setting only affect command
prompt windows started after the new setting took effect.

<H2>Building Mindy</H2>

On windows, we don't use the Unix Autoconf mechanism for building Mindy.
Instead, there is a Microsoft Visual C++ project file <SAMP>Mindy.mdp</SAMP> 
in <A HREF="../../src/mindy/MS-Windows">src/mindy/MS-Windows</A>.

Mindy must be compiled before the rest of the build process is done via
Makegen/nmake.  To recompile Mindy, follow these steps:
<UL>
	<LI>Copy <SAMP>MS-Windows\Mindy.*</SAMP> to <SAMP>src\mindy\</SAMP>
	<LI>Fire up Visual C++ by double-clicking on Mindy.mak under the
	  file manager.
	<LI>Optionally, you can edit interp/mindy.h and change the value
	  of LIBDIR to indicate where Mindy should look for library
	  files.  If you edit this, you will not have to set the
	  DYLANDIR environment variable.  BINDIR does nothing useful
	  in the Windows version of Mindy, so leave it alone.
	<LI>Select Batch Build under Project.  Check "Compiler Release"
	  "Interpretter Release", (<EM>note deliberate misspelling</EM>)
           and "Shitpile Release".  Select Build.  This will build
           the executables 
<SAMP>src\mindy\Interpretter\Release\Interpretter.exe</SAMP>
	and <SAMP>src\mindy\Compiler\Release\Mindycomp.exe</SAMP>.
These executables will later be installed in the appropriate places with the
appropriate names by "<SAMP>nmake install</SAMP>", but for now they will be run
as is.
</UL>

<H2>Configuring with Makegen</H2>

<A HREF="tools.html">Makegen</A> generates <SAMP>nmake</SAMP> makefiles which
do most of the work of building Gwydion Dylan.
Create a directory to be the root of the build tree, hereafter referred to as
<SAMP>build\</SAMP>, normally <SAMP>c:\dylan\build</SAMP>.  cd to
<SAMP>build\</SAMP> and
<PRE>
	copy ..\src\Defaults.win32 Defaults
</PRE>
Edit the Defaults file as you please to configure the build.  Note in
particular the setting of <CODE>$prefix</CODE> to <SAMP>c:\dylan</SAMP>.


Now, if you have the binary distribution installed and
have set PATH correctly, then you should be able to say:
<PRE>
	mk-build-tree
	nmake
	nmake install
</PRE>
And the build and install will complete automagically.
