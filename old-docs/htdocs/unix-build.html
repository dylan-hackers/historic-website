<H2>Building Gwydion Dylan on Unix</H2>
<HR>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><H2>Automatic Configuration</H2>
<DD>
To configure Gwydion Dylan for your system, simply type
"<SAMP>./configure</SAMP>" and wait for configure to figure things out.  When
that is done, begin the compilation by typing "<SAMP>make</SAMP> (or
"<SAMP>gmake</SAMP>" if you have GNU make).  When the compilation is done, type
"<SAMP>make install</SAMP>" to install the executable and libraries.  (Note:
you will need write permission for the directories that files are being installed to; see below)

<P>
The default installation directory for executables is 
<SAMP>/usr/local/bin</SAMP>;
for libraries it is <SAMP>/usr/local/lib/dylan</SAMP>  You can change the prefix
for these paths from <SAMP>/usr/local</SAMP> to <VAR>whatever</VAR> by typing
"<SAMP>configure --prefix=</SAMP><VAR>whatever</VAR>".
It is not a good idea to specify the path name
using a tilde (~) because tilde has a special meaning only in csh.
make uses sh, so tildes probably won't do what you want them to.

<P>
If you want to build in <VAR>one-place</VAR> while the sources are
kept in <VAR>another-place</VAR>, then type:
<PRE>
    cd <VAR>one-place</VAR>; <VAR>another-place</VAR>/configure
</PRE>
and <SAMP>configure</SAMP> will construct the appropriate directories and
Makefiles.

<P>
<DT><H2>Custom Configuration</H2>
<DD>
If the automatic configuration doesn't work, or if you need to specify
different optimization options, etc., then things get more interesting, and you
need to have some understanding of how things work.  Though an Autoconf
generated configure script is used as the front end to configuration, only the
C code for <SAMP>mindy</SAMP> and <SAMP>mindycomp</SAMP> really make use of
autoconf in any nontrivial way.  All of the Dylan code is configured using the
<A HREF="tools.html">Makegen</A> mechanism, which is a system of Perl scripts.


<P>
<H3>Autoconf overrides</H3>

The compilation of mindy and mindycomp can be tweaked via environment
variables:
<PRE>
	CC	specifies the C compiler to use
	CCOPTS	specifies options to pass to the C compiler
	YACC	specifies the parser generator
	LEX	specifies the lexer generator
	LFLAGS	specifies the flags passed to LEX
</PRE>

The default C compiler options (<SAMP>CCOPTS</SAMP>) are 
"<SAMP>-g -O4 -finline-functions -Wall</SAMP>" if you are using gcc, 
and "<SAMP>-g -O</SAMP>" otherwise.
If you are not using gcc, we <EM>highly</EM> recommend you read the man page
for your compiler and supply the flags that ask for the maximum optimization.
(Note that on many compilers, <SAMP>-g</SAMP>, "generate debugging information",
and <SAMP>-O</SAMP>, "optimize", are mutually exclusive.  If you have to choose
between the two, go with optimization.)

<P>
Options can be passed to make by using environment variables: Using
<SAMP>/bin/sh</SAMP>, say 
"<SAMP>VARNAME=option make -e</SAMP>" (<SAMP>-e</SAMP> tells make to look at the
environment variables).  Under gmake, options can also be passed via
the command line: "<SAMP>gmake VARNAME=option</SAMP>".

<P>
<H3>Makegen parameters</H3>

To change parameters to Makegen, change the <SAMP>Defaults</SAMP> file at the
root of the Gwydion build tree.  The default <SAMP>Defaults</SAMP> is created
by <SAMP>configure</SAMP> from <SAMP>configure.in</SAMP>.

<P>
You can clean up any previously made object files and executables 
with "<SAMP>make clean</SAMP>".

<P>Here's what a sample installation might look like:
<PRE>
        /bin/sh           # Need the Bourne shell to pass options to make
	./configure --prefix=/usr/bob
	CCOPTS="-g -O3" make -e
	make install
	exit              # exit the shell you just launched
</PRE>
This would install binaries to <SAMP>/usr/bob/bin</SAMP>, and library files to
<SAMP>/usr/bob/lib/dylan</SAMP>.
	

<DT><H2>Porting Gwydion Dylan</H2>
<DD>

In theory it should be possible to get Gwydion Dylan working on most any
machine that has an ANSI C compiler.  In practice, some assembly is required.
<P>
<DL>

<DT><EM>Porting Mindy</EM>
<DD>
Mindy is pretty portable, and versions of Mindy have been successfully built on
the following platforms:
<PRE>
	Hardware	OS		Compiler
	--------	--		--------
	HP Apollo	HPUX 9.03	gcc
	HP 9000/800	HPUX A.09.04	cc
	DEC pmax 	Mach 2.6	gcc
	DEC pmax	Ultrix 4.x	gcc
	SGI 		IRIX 4.0.5 	gcc and sgi-cc
	SGI 		IRIX 5.2 	sgi-cc
	Sun 		SunOS 4.11	gcc
	Sun		Solaris	2.3	cc
	IBM PowerPC 250	AIX 4.1		cc
	PC clone 	Linux 1.2.0     gcc
</PRE>
<P>
Mindy can <EM>not</EM> be built out of the box on the DEC Alpha.  If you
would like to port Mindy to the Alpha or any other architecture where
Mindy does not easily compile, send mail to
  <A HREF="mailto:gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu">gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu</A>
and we will try to provide as much help as we can.

<P>
<DT><EM>Porting d2c</EM>
<DD>
d2c is not as portable as Mindy:
<UL>
<LI> It has some knowledge of the assembler
pseudo-ops in order to build the initial heap image (no actual instructions are
generated this way.)
<LI> It has to know how to run the C compiler, build libraries, run make,
generate makefiles, etc.
<LI> It depends on the 
  <A HREF="../../src/d2c/runtime/gc/README">
Boehm conservative garbage collector</A>.
</UL>
<P>
The main hooks for porting d2c are the Makegen <SAMP>Defaults</SAMP> and the 
<SAMP><A HREF="../../src/d2c/compiler/platforms.descr">platforms.descr
</A></SAMP> files.  So far every port has also required Dylan code
modification, but you might be lucky.  Extra work is required to port Melange
and DIG, see the platform-specific files in those source directories.
</DL>

<P>
If you have successfully compiled Gwydion Dylan on another architecture,
please send mail to
 <A HREF="mailto:gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu">gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu</A>
and we will add that architecture to the list.  Please include the
operating system version and what compiler you used.  If changes were
required, please send diffs as well.
<P>

<DT><H2>Build Trouble Shooting Tips</H2>
<DD>
<DL>
<P><DT>When I went to "<SAMP>make install</SAMP>" I got permission denied errors.
<DD>
  You need to be the super user to install into <SAMP>/usr/local</SAMP>. Become
  the 
  super user, or ask you system admin to do it for you, or pick an
  unprivileged  location, eg your home directory, and re-run configure:
  "<SAMP>./configure --prefix=$HOME; make install</SAMP>"

<P><DT>
	
When I tried "<SAMP>prefix=$HOME make -e install</SAMP>" the shell said
"<SAMP>prefix=$HOME: Command not found</SAMP>".
<DD>
  You're running a C shell, while our instructions tell you how to pass local
  environment bindings using the Bourne shell (<SAMP>/bin/sh</SAMP>).  You can
  run the standard <SAMP>/bin/sh</SAMP> and repeat the procedure, or you may set
  the environments globally with the C shell `setenv' command before running
  make.

<P><DT>When I went to "<SAMP>make install</SAMP>" I got 
"<SAMP>cannot unlink</SAMP>" errors.
<DD>
  The <SAMP>install-sh</SAMP> script is trying to rename the files rather than
  copying them.  Try "<SAMP>MVPROG=cp make install</SAMP>". 

<P><DT> When I went to `make' the compiler choked making 
<SAMP>mindy/compat/sigaction.o</SAMP>.
<DD>
  Your machine does not have a POSIX signal handling package, and the
  default fallback to BSD signal handling didn't work either.  You can
  try the System V emulation by adding -DUSG_SIGNALS to the options used
  to compile sigaction.o.  Alternatively, there may be some magic word
  that is needed to open up the BSD compatibility on your system.  Look
  in <SAMP>/usr/include/signal.h</SAMP> and see if it gives any clues.

<P><DT>Everything went fine until the final linking step for mindy or
  mindycomp, then I got a message about undefined symbols.
<DD>
  You've found a hole in our compat library.  It could be easy or
  difficult to fix.  Send mail to
 <A HREF="mailto:gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu">gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu</A>.
  Please include the operating system version and what compiler you
  used.

<P><DT>I'm compiling Mindy, and I get this error:
<PRE>
	ld: driver.o: relocation format botch (symbol type))
	collect2: ld returned 4 exit status
</PRE>
<DD>

  There is a bug in some versions of gcc for the Sun.  Try recompiling
  <SAMP>driver.o</SAMP> with a different compiler or with optimizations off.
