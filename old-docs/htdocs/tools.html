<DT><h3>DYLAN Tools</h2>
<DD>
d2c comes bundled with a variety of tools.  Some of them are required
for rebuilding d2c, like gen-makefile.  Others are useful Dylan tools,
like Melange and parsergen.  Still others have nothing at all to do
with Dylan or d2c.  These tools are used by the Gwydion project for
development, and we found it easiest to ship them with d2c.  (Most of
these tools are for making life with the RCS versioning system
somewhat less painful)

<P>
<DL>
<DT><A href="../../src/tools/elisp/">elisp</A>
<DD>This directory contains a <A
href="../../src/tools/elisp/dylan-mode.el">Dylan mode</A> for GNU Emacs and
some other more trivial utilities.
<P>
<DT><A href="../../src/tools/shared-misc/mk-build-tree">mk-build-tree</A> 
[-p<VAR>platforms.descr</VAR>]
<DT><A href="../../src/tools/shared-misc/gen-makefile">gen-makefile</A>
[-p<VAR>platforms.descr</VAR>] [<VAR>subdir</VAR>]
<DD>These two scripts together comprise the entry points to the Makegen
facility.  This is tool which facilitates use of Make with Dylan programs, and also provides for
arbitrary platform conditionalization of makefiles.  Makegen uses the
same platforms.descr file used by d2c to get platform specific parameters.
<P>
<SAMP>gen-makefile</SAMP> reads the
file <SAMP>Defaults</SAMP> at the root of the build tree and the
<SAMP>Makegen</SAMP> files in each subdirectory.  Both of these files can
contain arbitrary Perl code, but in practice are highly stylized.  There is
considerable user documentation in comments in the source.  In addition to the
file start comment, see the comments on the routines tagged
"<CODE>-- exported</CODE>".
<P>
<SAMP>mk-build-tree</SAMP> creates a build tree using a source tree as a
template, and populates it with Makefiles by calling <SAMP>gen-makefile</SAMP>.

<P>
<DT><a href="../maker-out/melange.htm">Melange</A>
<DD>
Melange generates Dylan interfaces to C libraries more
or less automatically by doing an analysis of the the <SAMP>.h</SAMP> header
files.

<P>
<DT><a href="../../src/tools/parsergen/">parsergen</A>
<DD>
A simple LALR1 parser generator for Dylan, used by d2c and Melange.

<P>
<DT><A HREF="../../src/tools/synopsis/">synopsis</A>
[<SAMP>-exported</SAMP>] <VAR>output-file input1</VAR> [<VAR>input2</VAR>..]
<DD>
A tool which generates a synopsis (interface summary) of some Dylan sources.
<SAMP> -exported</SAMP> means show only definitions that are exported,
and - as an output-file means to use standard output..


<P>
<DT><A HREF="../../src/tools/make-exports/">make-exports</A>
<DD>A tool which automatically generates Dylan module and library definition
forms based on breadcrumbs in comments in the source code.  See the source
comments for more documentation.

<P>
<DT><A HREF="../../src/tools/versioner/">versioner</A>
<DD>This is an RCS-related tool.  See also the 
<A HREF="../../src/tools/win32-misc/">win32-misc/</A> for windows RCS 
and unix compatibility scripts.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="../../src/tools/lisp2dylan/">lisp2dylan</A>
<DD>A program that provides a rough translation of Common Lisp into dylan.
</DL>

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Melange and parsergen are written in Dylan.  This means
that you must have a working Dylan compiler in order to compile them.  And you
must have a compiled parsergen in order to compile the compiler.  This
circularity was originally bootstrapped by using Mindy, but the source
distribution also includes the output Dylan files generated by these tools, so
you don't actually need to run Melange and parsergen to build the system.
