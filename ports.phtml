<P>Several developers have volunteered to help out as soon as Gwydion is
supported on their architecture. Porting Gwydion to a new species of Unix
requires a supported platform, the new platform, a fast network connection,
and a few days work. Currently supported platforms are</P>

<UL>
<LI>Linux (x86, PPC), with packages as tarballs, RPMs and DEBs
<LI>FreeBSD (it's in the ports)
<LI>Solaris
<LI>OpenBSD
<LI>MacOS
<LI>MacOS X
<LI>Windows with cygwin/gcc
</UL>

<P>Several existing ports need a maintainer:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows with Visual C++
<LI>HP-UX
</UL>

If there is no binary for the current version of Gwydion Dylan for
your platform, get an older binary and compile the
sources. Alternatively you can use the Dylan interpreter for
bootstrapping. Please upload your binary <a
href="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/incoming">here</a>, so others can
benefit from your work.
