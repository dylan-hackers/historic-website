<P>We're a group of volunteers working to create new development tools,
with a focus on Unix-like systems. We have updated <A
HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/gwydion/docs/htdocs/gwydion/">CMU's
Gwydion Dylan</A>, fixing many bugs and making it work well under modern
versions of Linux and FreeBSD. Our <A HREF="downloading.phtml">current
release</A> is a technology preview, suitable for learning Dylan and
building modest command-line applications. In the future, we want to create
one of the most advanced development tools available and donate it to the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</A>.</P>
