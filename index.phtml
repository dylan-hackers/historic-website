<P>Gwydion Dylan is an implementation of the Dylan programming language for
Unix systems. Originally written as a research project by the Gwydion group at CMU, it is now maintained by a group of volunteers.</P>

<P>The current version of Gwydion is development code, and <STRONG>intended
only for use by Dylan fanatics</STRONG>. The compiler is slow, lacks shared
library support and still needs lots of bug fixes. To make life more
exciting, the documentation is incomplete, and you'll need to read the
source and ask questions on the mailing list. If this sounds like fun,
you'll enjoy Gwydion.</P>

<P>To make Gwydion a truly useful compiler, we'll need to solve three or
four <STRONG>hard problems</STRONG>:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Figure out how to maintain binary compatibility between two versions of
a shared library.
<LI>Reduce the code size of Dylan-to-C glue.
<LI>Speed up the compiler (and/or implement incremental compilation)
<LI>Add Dylan support to GDB.
</UL>

<P>Thanks to the skilled programmers at CMU, Gwydion can already generate
<STRONG>exceptionally efficient</STRONG> code (half the speed of C in most
cases) and implements about 98% of the Dylan standard with many extra
libraries.</P>

<P>Someday we'd like Gwydion Dylan to look like <A HREF="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/misc/browsers1.png">this</A> or <A HREF="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/misc/browsers2.png">this</A>. (Screenshots of Apple Dylan.) Of course, it will still run as a "normal" command-line compiler, too.</P>
