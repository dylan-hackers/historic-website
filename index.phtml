<P>We're a group of volunteers working to create new development tools,
with a focus on Unix-like systems. We have updated <A
HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/gwydion/docs/htdocs/gwydion/">CMU's
Gwydion Dylan</A>, fixing many bugs and making it work well under modern
versions of Linux and FreeBSD. Our <A HREF="downloading.phtml">current
release</A> is a technology preview, suitable for learning Dylan and
building modest command-line applications. In the future, we want to create
one of the most advanced development tools available and donate it to the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</A>.</P>

<DT><STRONG>Posting on Dylan's new approach to OO (13 Jan 2000)</strong></dt> 

<dd><p>Michael T. Richter sent a <a href="mtr-on-dylan.txt">posting</a> to the <a
href="news:comp.lang.dylan">comp.lang.dylan</a> newsgroup explaining
that he likes Dylan because of his new approach to OO, splitting up
classes into several orthogonal aspects. Interesting read for all who
are still trying to figure out what's so special about Dylan.

<DT><STRONG>David Lichteblau releases new dfingerd and assorted libraries (20 Oct 1999)</strong></dt> 

<dd><p><a href="mailto:lichtebl@math.fu-berlin.de">David
Lichteblau</a> released version 1.0 of <a
href="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/contributions/dfingerd-1.0.tar.gz">dfingerd</a>,
his fingerd implementation written in Dylan. You can find out more
about it <a
href="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/contributions/dfingerd-1.0.txt">here</a>. This
release is coupled to the release of new versions of his libraries <a
href="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/contributions/unix-interface-0.1.tar.gz">unix-interface</a>,
<a
href="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/contributions/network-0.1pre1.tar.gz">network</a>,
<a
href="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/contributions/meta-0.5.tar.gz">meta</a>
and <a
href="ftp://berlin.ccc.de/pub/gd/contributions/xformat-0.3.tar.gz">xformat</a>.
Please see the *.txt files in the contributions directory on one of
the <a href="downloading.phtml">FTP servers</a> for
details. </p><p>Passive FTP on our main FTP site, berlin.ccc.de, has
been fixed btw. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>


<DT><STRONG>First working version of d2c for MacOS reported (20 Oct 1999)</strong></dt> 

<dd><p><a href="mailto:robm@lostwax.com">Rob Myers</a> announced on
the gd-hackers mailing list that he has built a first version of d2c,
the Dylan compiler that's part of Gwydion, for MacOS. He expects to be
able to release patches next week. This means that Gwydion Dylan now
works on all major platforms (although nobody maintains the Win32 port
at the moment).</p>


<DT><STRONG>Functional Objects Inc. acquires Harlequin Dylan (10 Oct 1999)</strong></dt> 

<dd><p> Harlequin has sold all the rights to Harlequin Dylan, the
commercial implementation of Dylan, to the freshly founded Functional
Objects, Inc. Basically, these are the guys that worked on Dylan at
Harlequin, so this is definitely no bad news, and could turn out to be
actually quite good for Dylan, since their <a
href="http://www.functionalobjects.com/news/press-release-1.html">press
release</a> actually talks about ports of Harlequin Dylan to other
platforms than the already existing Win32.</p><p>Good luck, guys!</p>
