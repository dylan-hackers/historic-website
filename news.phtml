<DT><STRONG>Posting on Dylan's new approach to OO (13 Jan 2000)</strong></dt> 

<dd><p>Michael T. Richter sent a <a href="mtr-on-dylan.txt">posting</a> to the <a
href="news:comp.lang.dylan">comp.lang.dylan</a> newsgroup explaining
that he likes Dylan because of his new approach to OO, splitting up
classes into several orthogonal aspects. Interesting read for all who
are still trying to figure out what's so special about Dylan.

<DT><STRONG>First working version of d2c for MacOS reported (20 Oct 1999)</strong></dt> 

<dd><p><a href="mailto:robm@lostwax.com">Rob Myers</a> announced on
the gd-hackers mailing list that he has built a first version of d2c,
the Dylan compiler that's part of Gwydion, for MacOS. He expects to be
able to release patches next week. This means that Gwydion Dylan now
works on all major platforms (although nobody maintains the Win32 port
at the moment).</p>

<DT><STRONG>Functional Objects Inc. acquires Harlequin Dylan (10 Oct 1999)</strong></dt> 

<dd><p> Harlequin has sold all the rights to Harlequin Dylan, the
commercial implementation of Dylan, to the freshly founded Functional
Objects, Inc. Basically, these are the guys that worked on Dylan at
Harlequin, so this is definitely no bad news, and could turn out to be
actually quite good for Dylan, since their <a
href="http://www.functionalobjects.com/news/press-release-1.html">press
release</a> actually talks about ports of Harlequin Dylan to other
platforms than the already existing Win32.</p><p>Good luck, guys!</p>

<DT><STRONG>Gwydion Dylan Status Report (24 Dec 1998)</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
<P>We're pushing towards a code freeze now. A few outstanding bugs need
fixing (see the <STRONG>critical</STRONG> section in the bug tracker), bits
of Melange need further study, and our documentation is still not
completely resolved.</P>

<P>Jeff Dubrule has ported Mindy to run on a 64-bit system (RedHat 5.2
Alpha), and has started work on d2c. (These ports will not be included
in 2.2.) Peter Housel and Matthias Hoelzl have been stomping bugs left and
right, and Eric Kidd has rewritten getopt and cooked up some man pages.
Andreas has been working to make Melange play nicely with Gtk+, and Peter
Hinely has been helping edit our documentation. Shaleh has bootstrapped d2c
under Debian, and should have debs sometime soon.</P>
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Gwydion Dylan 2.1.2 Released (1 Dec 1998)</STRONG></DT>

<DD><P>

  things which should be done <EM>before</EM> we have users.

  adding to the documentation.

  parse most of the standard Linux C headers and automatically generate
  Dylan interfaces.
