><LI
><DIV
CLASS="FORMALPARA"
><P
><B
>Decisions are made by consensus. </B
>In general, we make an effort to discuss tricky problems
	    until all the major contributors agree. This is similar to the
	    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>IETF</SPAN
>'s philosophy of &#8220;rough consensus
	    and running code&#8221;. If you think a decision is wrong,
	    explain your viewpoint carefully and be prepared to back it up
	    with code. Use the magic phrase often: &#8220;Does anybody
	    object to this?&#8221;</P
></DIV
></LI
><LI
><DIV
CLASS="FORMALPARA"
><P
><B
>Final rulings are made by the core team. </B
>The core team consists of the most prolific Gwydion
      	    developers and those who have been involved the longest. If the
      	    other contributors would feel guilty about making a decision
      	    without considering your opinion, you're effectively a member
      	    of the core team.</P
></DIV
><P
>Decisions within the core team should be made by unanimous
	  consent whenever possible. This seems to have worked well enough
	  historically. If this process ever breaks down in the future, the
	  core team might choose to vote as measure of last resort.</P
></LI
><LI
><DIV
CLASS="FORMALPARA"
><P
><B
>No due dates. </B
>As a matter of policy, we do not promise completion dates
	    to outside entities. This is because of the volunteer nature of
	    the project and the traditional unreliablity of software
	    estimation. Of course, individuals may promise due dates of
	    their own, but nobody else will take responsibility for meeting
	    those dates.</P

>Don't bite off more than you can chew. </B
>Work on one or two projects at a time. Don't commit to
	    implementing many separate libraries or fixing many separate
	    bugs. By &#8220;reserving&#8221; too many areas, you
	    effectively discourage others from working on them.</P
