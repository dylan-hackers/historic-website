<H2>NAME</H2>

Dylan - An object-oriented, dynamic language.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Dylan is an object-oriented, dynamic, infix, garbage-collected programming
language with support for multiple inheritence, multiple dispatch (an
advanced form of polymorphism), typed and untyped variables, closures and
exceptions. Dylan also supports pattern-based hygenic macros. These allow
you to define new control constructs and fully integrate them with the
language.
<P>

Dylan (theoretically) combines the performance of C or C++ with the rapid
development of Perl and the expressiveness of LISP. It looks similar to C
or Pascal, so experienced programmers can learn to write simple programs
quickly.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>

Dylan was originally designed by Apple Computer's Advanced Development
Labs. They were using several languages at the time: SmallTalk and LISP for
research prototypes, and C and C++ for end-user applications. They wanted
one language which could be used for everything.
<P>

With help from Harlequin and the Gwydion Group at CMU, Apple revised and
improved Dylan. Each agreed to implement Dylan for a specific platform:
Apple would handle the MacOS, Harlequin would handle Windows, and the
Gwydion Group would develop for Unix.
<P>

Things didn't go so well for Apple. The company was loosing money and
decided to cancel most of their non-MacOS development work.  Harlequin
fared better--they just released Harlequin Dylan 1.1, which generates
efficient code and includes a powerful GUI toolkit. The Gwydion Group made
excellent progress before moving on to other research areas.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESIGN</H2>

Dylan, like Java, is heavily redesigned form of LISP with many features
stripped out and a special focus on performance. Java chose a somewhat
easier route: it replaced almost all of the object system, eliminated
dynamic typing and removed any powerful but hard-to-optimize features.
<P>

The Dylan designers chose to take a somewhat more radical approach. They
left in the powerful object model, dynamic typing, and many advanced
features such as closures and integrated macros. In most cases, the Dylan
version of a feature was simplified, but not removed. For example, the
Dylan object model includes generic functions (with multimethods), but
omits the meta-object protocol and method combination rules.
<P>

Dylan did include, however, many new features to help the compiler generate
efficient code. Programmers can specify type declarations to help the
compiler infer types, or they can omit the type declarations if they don't
care about peformance. Special classes allow the efficient representation
of vectors and arrays of primitive types. Libraries can forbid their
clients to subclass certain types, allowing method dispatch to be performed
at compile time.
<P>

Because of these decisions, Dylan needs a powerful optimizer to produce
efficient code. Fortunately, the techniques for implementing such
optimizers are well-understood, even if a lot of work is involved.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PERFORMANCE</H2>

A good Dylan compiler can match a C or C++ compiler in most ways, providing
the programmer is willing to use type declarations and avoid the more
expensive features.
<P>

Harlequin's Dylan compiler can generate code which matches the performace
of C on many benchmarks, even those involving complex numeric calculations.
Gwydion Dylan generates code about half as good as the underlying C
compiler. Limited collection types must be used when processing large
amounts of data, of course.
<P>

Memory usage for a Dylan program is about twice that of an equivalent C
program, thanks to the garbage collector. However, the amortitized
allocation and collection speed of a good modern garbage collector is
effectively the same as that of malloc and free.
<P>

Using recent research, generic function dispatch can be performed at the
price of three or four instructions per polymorphic argument. Membership in
a class can be determined in constant time. Graph-coloring algorithms can
be used to optimize slot access in the presence of multiple inheritence.
<P>

In light of these facts, Dylan appears to be a good choice for application
development and an entirely reasonable choice for certain kinds of systems
programming. Due to its LISP heritage, however, it is still useful for
complex symbolic processing, fancy data structure manipulation and rapid
prototyping.
