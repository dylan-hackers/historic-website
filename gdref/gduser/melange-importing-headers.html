>You import C definitions into Dylan by specifying one or more
      header files in an "#include" clause. This may take one of two
      different forms:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>define interface
   #include "file1.h";
end interface;</PRE
><P
>or</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>define interaface
   #include {"file1.h", "file2.h"};
end interface;</PRE
><P
>Melange will parse all of the named files in the specified
      order, and produce Dylan equivalents for (i.e. "import") some
      fraction of declarations in these files. By default, Melange
      will import all of the declarations from the named files, and
      any declarations in recursively included files (i.e. those
      specified via "#include" directives in the ".h" file) which are
      referenced by imported definitions. It will not, however, import
      every declaration in recursively included files. This insures
      that you will see a complete, usable, set of declarations
      without having to closely control the importation process. If
      you wish to exert more control over the set of objects to be
      imported, you may do so via the "import", "exclude", and
      "exclude-file" options.</P
><P
>If you only need a small set of definitions from a set of
      imported files, you can explicitly specify the complete list of
      declarations to be imported by using the "import:" option. You
      could, for example, say:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>define interface
   #include "gc.h",
      import: {"scavenge", "transport" =&#62; move};
end interface;</PRE
><P
>This would result in Dylan definitions for "scavenge",
      "move", "&#60;obj_t&#62;", and "&#60;obj&#62;".  The latter types
      would be dragged in because they are referenced by the two
      imported functions.  Again, if you equated "obj_t" to
      &#60;object&#62; then neither of the types would be imported. The
      second import in the above example performs a renaming at the
      same time as it specifies the object to be imported. Other forms
      specify global behaviors. "Import: all" willcause Melange to
      import every "top level" definition which is not explicitly
      excluded. "Import: all-recursive" causes it to import
      definitions from recursively included files as well. "Import:
      none" restricts importation to those declarations which are
      explicitly imported or are used by an imported declaration.  You
      may also use the "import:" option to specify importation
      behavior on a per-file basis. The options</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>import: "file.h" =&#62; {"import1", ...}
import: "file.h" =&#62; all
import: "file.h" =&#62; none</PRE
><P
>work like the options described above, except that they
      only apply to the symbols in a single imported file.  The
      "exclude:" and "exclude-file:" options may be used to keep one
      or more unwanted definitions from being imported. For example,
      you could use:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>define interface
   #include "gc.h",
      exclude: {"scavenge", "transport"},
      exclude-file: "gc1.h";
end interface;</PRE
><P
>This would prevent the two named functions and everything
      in the named file from being imported, while still including all
      of the other definitions from "gc.h". Note that these options
      should be used with care, as they can easily result in
      "incomplete" interfaces in which some declarations refer to
      types which are not defined. This could result in errors in the
      generated Dylan code. (The "import: file =&#62; none" option
      described above is a safer way of achieving an effect similar to
      "exclude-file:"</P
><P
>You may also prevent some type declarations from being
      imported by using the "equate:" option (described in a later
      section). If, for example, you equated "obj_t" to
      &#60;object&#62;, then Melange would ignore the definition for
      "obj_t" and simply assume that the existing definition for
      &#60;object&#62; was sufficient.</P
><P
>You may have any number of "import:", "exclude:", and
      "exclude-file:" options, and may name the same declarations in
      multiple clauses. "Exclude:" options take priority over
      "import:"s. If no "import:" options are specified, the system
      will import all non-excluded symbols, just as if you had said
      "import: all".</P
